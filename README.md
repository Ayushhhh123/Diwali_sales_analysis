# 🪔 Diwali Sales Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Diwali sales data using Python. The primary goal is to derive business insights from customer purchasing behavior during the Diwali festival season. This analysis can help improve marketing strategies, customer targeting, and overall sales performance.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Key insights are derived related to:

- Gender-wise and age-wise purchasing trends
- Occupation-based purchasing power
- State-level performance in sales
- Product category preferences
- Spending behavior across various demographics

## 📁 Files

- `Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete data analysis workflow.
- (Optional: `diwali_sales.csv`): The dataset used for analysis (not included due to file size or licensing — please include your own or add a note on how to obtain it).

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for running and documenting the analysis

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Men spend more during Diwali compared to women.
- Individuals aged between 26–35 were the most active buyers.
- Working professionals and married individuals tended to spend more.
- States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka contributed significantly to total sales.
